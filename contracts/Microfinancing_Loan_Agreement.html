  <li>
    No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined herein) has occurred or is continuing,
    and no material adverse change has occurred in the Borrower’s financial condition or circumstances which,
    in the sole discretion of the Lender, may affect the Borrower’s ability to meet repayment obligations.
  </li>
  <li>
    All other pre-disbursement formalities and conditions prescribed by the Lender under its internal policies
    and the Sanction Letter have been duly complied with by the Borrower.
  </li>
</ol>


  <h2>6. INTEREST</h2>

<p>
  The Loan shall carry interest at the rate specified in the Sanction Letter and the KFS,
  determined in accordance with the Lender’s prevailing Interest Rate Policy and in compliance with Applicable Laws.
</p>

<p>
  Unless otherwise specified in the Sanction Letter, interest shall accrue from the Disbursement Date on the outstanding
  principal balance of the Loan and shall be calculated on a reducing balance basis, using a 365-day year for actual days elapsed.
</p>

<p>
  Interest shall be debited to the Loan account at such intervals as may be specified in the Sanction Letter
  and shall form part of the Borrower’s repayment obligations under the Repayment Schedule attached as
  <strong>Schedule-4</strong> to this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
  Any change in the Interest Rate shall be made only in accordance with the Lender’s Interest Policy and Applicable Laws,
  and shall be communicated to the Borrower in writing or in such manner as may be agreed between the Borrower and the Lender.
</p>

<p>
  If the Borrower fails to pay any interest on the due date, the Lender may, without prejudice to any of its rights,
  capitalise such unpaid interest (to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws), which shall thereafter carry
  interest at the rate applicable to the Loan.
</p>

<p>
  If the Borrower defaults in payment of any instalment or part thereof on the due date,
  the Borrower shall be liable to pay Overdue Interest or penal charges, calculated only on the overdue amount,
  at the rate specified in the Sanction Letter and the KFS, from the date of default until the date of actual payment.
</p>


  <h2>7. REPAYMENT</h2>

<p>
  The Borrower shall repay the Loan, together with all interest, charges, and other amounts payable under this Agreement,
  in the instalments and on the due dates specified in the Repayment Schedule.
  The Repayment Schedule shall form an integral part of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
  All repayments shall be made by the Borrower by bank transfer to the Lender’s account or any other permissible mode,

</p>

<p>Unless otherwise agreed, payments received from the Borrower shall be appropriated in the following order:</p>

  <li>Overdue Interest or penal charges;</li>
  <li>accrued interest; and</li>
  <li>principal outstanding.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The Borrower may, at any time during the tenure of the Loan, prepay the whole or any part of the outstanding principal amount,
  together with interest accrued thereon, without any prepayment penalty. Upon such prepayment, the Repayment Schedule shall
  be revised accordingly and communicated to the Borrower.
</p>

<p>
  Any payment made by the Borrower prior to the relevant due date shall first be appropriated towards amounts already due and payable,
  and any surplus may, at the Lender’s discretion, be applied towards future instalments, in which case the Lender may revise
  the Repayment Schedule.
</p>

<p>If the Borrower fails to pay any instalment in full on its due date:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>
    the Borrower shall be liable to pay Overdue Interest or penal charges calculated only on the overdue amount,
    from the date of default until payment; and
  </li>
  <li>
    such default shall constitute an <strong>Event of Default</strong> under this Agreement.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Where the Borrower makes a partial prepayment, the Lender may, in consultation with the Borrower,
  either reduce the amount of future instalments or shorten the remaining loan tenure,
  as per the Borrower’s preference and in accordance with the Lender’s policy.
